Repository for releasing installible packages for end users

Just download the package as .zip or .tgz.  For Windows users unzip first in Windows Explorer and then click on installible .exe file within the folder structure.  Clicking on the .zip file and then clicking on the .exe within the .zip doesn't seem to work.

If any problems installing--reboot computer and try to install again.
